# Delegate Task to Workspace Session (Experimental)

> **This command is experimental and actively evolving.** VK workspace session behavior is being tested. Expect changes.

## Context

You are delegating a task to a separate VibeKanban workspace session. This spawns an entirely separate agent instance (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, or other supported executors) paired with a specific task and repository. The remote agent works independently in its own environment and branch.

This is different from `/work-parallel` (Tier 1), which uses local git worktrees. This command uses VibeKanban's `start_workspace_session` API (Tier 2) for full remote delegation.

## Instructions

### 1. Identify the Task

The user can identify a task in any of these ways:

- **Plan task ID** (e.g., `1.2`, `2.1`) -- Look it up in the development plan task tables
- **Task title or partial title** (e.g., `"auth"`, `"set up database"`) -- Fuzzy match against both the development plan and VibeKanban tasks
- **No input provided** -- List available tasks and ask which one to delegate

**Resolution logic:**

1. If the input matches a plan task ID pattern (digits.digits), look it up in `docs/development-plan.md`
2. Otherwise, treat it as a title search:
   - Use `list_projects` and `list_tasks` to fetch all VK tasks
   - Also check task titles in `docs/development-plan.md` if it exists
   - Find tasks whose title contains the search text (case-insensitive)
   - If multiple matches, show them and ask the user to pick one
   - If exactly one match, confirm it with the user before proceeding
3. If no match is found, show available tasks and ask the user to clarify

The task **must** exist in VibeKanban (have a VK task ID). If it only exists in the plan, tell the user to run `/generate-tasks` first.

### 2. Gather Context

Read these sources to understand the task:

1. **Development Plan** (`docs/development-plan.md`) -- if the task exists in the plan:
   - Task row: ID, title, description, priority, complexity, dependencies
   - Task Details: acceptance criteria
   - Epic context

2. **VibeKanban task** -- use `get_task` to fetch the full task details

3. **PRD** (`docs/prd.md`) -- relevant sections for context

### 3. Check Dependencies

- Parse the "Depends On" column for this task
- Use `list_tasks` / `get_task` to verify each dependency is `done` in VK
- If dependencies are NOT satisfied:
  - List which dependencies are incomplete
  - Warn the user that delegating this task may cause issues
  - Ask if they want to proceed anyway or pick a different task

### 4. Choose the Executor

Ask the user which agent should handle the task (if not already specified):

```
## Choose an Agent

Which agent should work on this task?

1. **CLAUDE_CODE** - Claude Code (default)
2. **CURSOR_AGENT** - Cursor
3. **CODEX** - OpenAI Codex
4. **GEMINI** - Google Gemini
5. **COPILOT** - GitHub Copilot
6. **DROID** - Custom agent

Or specify a different executor name.
```

If the user doesn't specify, default to `CLAUDE_CODE`.

### 5. Determine Repository and Branch

- Use `list_repos` to find the repositories associated with the project
- Use `get_repo` to get repository details
- Determine the base branch (typically `main` or `master`)

### 6. Confirm Before Delegating

Present a summary and ask for confirmation:

```
## Delegation Summary

### Task
- **ID:** [Task ID] - [Title]
- **Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
- **Complexity:** [S/M/L/XL]
- **Dependencies:** [All satisfied / List unmet]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]

### Workspace Session
- **Executor:** [CLAUDE_CODE / CURSOR_AGENT / etc.]
- **Repository:** [repo name]
- **Base branch:** [main]

Proceed with delegation?
```

**Do not start the workspace session until the user explicitly confirms.**

### 7. Start the Workspace Session

After user confirmation:

1. Use `start_workspace_session` with:
   - `task_id`: the VK task UUID
   - `executor`: the chosen agent type (e.g., `CLAUDE_CODE`)
   - `repos`: array with `repo_id` and `base_branch`

2. Report the result:

```
## Workspace Session Started

- **Task:** [ID] - [Title]
- **Agent:** [executor type]
- **Status:** Session launched

The agent is now working on this task in its own environment and branch.
```

### 8. Provide Post-Delegation Guidance

```
## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Check task status in the VibeKanban board
2. **Review**: When the task moves to `inreview`:
   - Open the task in VK to see the diff and full session history
   - Leave inline comments on specific lines of code
   - Send revision requests if changes are needed -- VK will start a new agent session in the same feature branch
3. **Merge**: When satisfied, use VK's merge button to merge the branch to main
4. **Sync**: Run `/sync-plan` to update the development plan

Use `/session-status` to check on active workspace sessions.
```

### 9. Handle Edge Cases

- **Task not in VK**: The task must exist in VibeKanban to delegate. Tell the user to run `/generate-tasks` first.
- **Task already in progress**: Warn the user. Ask if they want to delegate anyway (may create a conflicting session).
- **Task already done**: Inform the user. Ask if they want to re-delegate for rework.
- **No repos found**: Use `list_repos` to check. If no repos are configured for the project, inform the user that the VK project needs a repository linked.
- **Multiple repos**: If the project has multiple repos, ask the user which one(s) the task should work in.
- **Workspace session fails to start**: Report the error. Suggest checking VK project configuration and repo settings. **Known issue:** VK's server-side worktree manager can fail with `fatal: invalid reference` errors when creating the workspace branch (see [VK #306](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/issues/306) for a related issue). If this happens:
  1. Try `git worktree prune` on the repo VK is managing, then retry
  2. Check that VK is updated to the latest version
  3. **Fallback to Tier 1**: Use `/work-parallel` with the same task ID instead. This creates a local worktree and launches a Claude Code session directly, bypassing VK's worktree manager entirely. The agent still updates VK task status via MCP, and completion logs are appended to the task description. You lose VK's session history and diff view, but the task gets done.
